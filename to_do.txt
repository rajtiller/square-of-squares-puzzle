To-Do
-----------
For available squares, either offset them or just show how many there are
make it so there's no scrolling necessary

center a square's projection around the square (i.e. they have the same center)
make squares shrink on click
make it so projections only ever go on legal positions
make it so if you clikc on swaure in the reserve, it rnadomly puts it in a vlid position if one exists
when a square in the reserve is being dragged, remove it from the reserve display
don't give squares a shadown unless at least half of it is in the grid
